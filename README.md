an app created on android studio with kotlin language using the MVVM architecture with the help of my recently learned android development skills
this app is intended to help bike shop workers manage thier bikes rental by facilitating the booking procedure with the help of a user friendly UI while handling some calculations(price, bikes count, ...) witch can help workers being more productive.

in addition to bikes rental management, the app offers a basic but really handy solution to store marchandize order list that stores data locally using room database(SQL lite)
witch can be removed any time when the order is placed.
